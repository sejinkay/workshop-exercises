# Objectives
- Describe the value of isolating unit tests
- Explain how RSpec helps give you tools to do so
- Practice isolating unit tests with RSpec

# Starter (10mins)

The coach will recap week 1's mocking workshop and then demonstrate how to implement RSpec test doubles in the first test in `docking_station_spec.rb` in `/exercise1`

# Main (45mins)

## Instructions

There are two specs in each of the exercise directories. In each case, read and try to understand what's happening. **Clear, well-written specs help inform what the intention of the code is.**

1. Don't touch the code in `lib`, only edit the code in the `spec` directory.
2. At every point something is unclear, or there is a word you're unsure of exactly what it does, note it down and spend a few minutes researching with your pair.
3. Create a list of things you've learnt during this workshop.
4. Spend time refactoring the tests.

### Exercise 1 (25mins)

- replace the custom mocks using RSpec's `double` method.
- find a way to control the behaviour of the randomness
- refactor the tests

### Exercise 2 (20mins)

- replace the custom mocks using RSpec's `double` method in this slightly more complex example.
- refactor the tests

# Plenary (15mins)
A group discussion based on reflections on the starter and main.
- what did you learn?
- what felt difficult?
- what do you want more clarity on?
