# Following the Ajax request/response cycle

## Instructions

### High level goal for the week

At a high level, this week is about building the skills that let you learn a new language and its patterns.  In this workshop, you'll practice following the flow of control to understand the callbacks JavaScript pattern.

### Learning objectives

* Follow the Ajax request/response cycle in a piece of code.

### Following the flow of control

* Look at the code in `index.html`.

* We're going to act out the request/response cycle for this code.

* Each part (browser, Heroku server etc.) will be played by a person.

* We'll try and build a detailed picture of the order things happen in, and the information that is sent back and forth.
